# Top 10 List of Week 01

1.	What is VirtualBox

VirtualBox is an application that can support the creation of guest virtual machines such as Linux. The app allows the user to load multiple guest operation systems under a single host OS. The user is given the freedom to start, pause, or stop within the virtual machine

2.	Linux Operation System

Linux is the most used open source operating system. Linux is similar with other operating systems; it has a graphical interface and the same types of software we are accustomed to. Although the core systems are common, Linux is customizable because the many distributions of it.

3.	Debian

Debian is a Linux distribution composed of free and open-source software. Debian is considered as the most popular among the other distributions because it produces high quality, stable, and scalable distribution. It is also easy to install and uninstall.

4.	Virtual Memory in Operating System

Virtual Memory is a storage allocation scheme. It is a technique that is implemented using both hardware and software. It maps memory addresses using virtual addresses into the physical addresses in computer memory. It can “create the illusion to users of a very large memory”.

5.	Virtualization

Virtualization is the process of running a virtual instance of a computer system in a layer abstracted from the actual hardware. The common use of virtualization is to run applications meant for different operating system without have to switch computers.

6.	Virtualization: Pros

Advantages of using virtual machines are you can use multiple operating system environments on the same computer, able to create a virtual hard disk, provided with an ISA (instruction set architecture), and also some security benefits. For example, if you need to run an application of questionable security, you can run it in a guest operating system. So, if the application causes damage, then it will be only temporary after the guest is shut down.

7.	Virtualization: Cons

Using a virtual machine are less efficient than real machines because it accesses the hardware indirectly. Because it runs the software on top of the host operating system and that slows the usability. The other disadvantage is if the user runs several virtual machines together it may hinder the performance if the host computer lacks sufficient power.

8.	Cloud Operating System

A cloud operating system is a type of operating system designed to operate within cloud computing and virtualization environments. Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is an instant computing infrastructure, provisioned and managed over the internet. It’s one of the four types of cloud services, along with software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and serverless.

9.	Virtual File System

Modern operating system is able to implement multiple system files in the same time, one of the techniques is using VFS (Virtual File System). The idea of using VFS is inserting information on the kernel to represent the system. A VFS specifies an interface between the kernel and a concrete file system. So, for every system call such as read(), write(), open(), etc. the kernel will substitute it into a real function that is owned by the system itself.

10.	Regex

Regex is the short for regular expression. It is a string of text that allows the user to create patterns in order to manage the text. Regex seems like different language to users that are new to it, however mastering regular expressions can save you time if you need to parse large amounts of data. But not all programs share the same regular expressions, they do share similarities, though.
